# rss

This repository contains a collection of RSS feeds I created to make it easier to keep up to date with our state governments. I like reading my news through RSS readers, but noticed most state governments & opposition (ACT, NT & Jodi McKay excepted) didn't provide feeds for their announcements.

Pull requests can be made to [gov-rss/scrape](http://github.com/gov-rss/scrape) if there are additional sources you would like to see hosted here.
